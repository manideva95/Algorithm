# JavaScript Algorithms - The Fundamentals

Algorithms are a complex, yet vital part of programming and of being a developer!

What algorithms are
Why algorithms are important
How to judge and compare algorithms
All about “Time Complexity”, “Space Complexity” and the “Big O” notation
Different time complexities and how to derive them
How to use recursion with algorithms
Optimization approaches like “Dynamic Programming”
All core concepts you need for math, search, sorting and sets/ array algorithms
Different kinds of solving problems (e.g. greedy approaches, dynamic approaches)
By the end of the course, you will have a very solid foundation and a plan on how to tackle any problem and find a fitting algorithm! You will be well-prepared to dive deeper and explore more problems and algorithms.
